      <h2>My first tremester in high school</h2>
      <p>I learnt in high school Imerimandroso which is a town and commune (Malagasy: kaominina) in Madagascar
        .It belongs to the district of Ambatondrazaka, which is a part of Alaotra-Mangoro Region.
        Imerimandroso is 7 kilometers from my village.
        I really loved this high school because I got good knowledge from it.</p>
      <p>In 2013 I started to study in this school.In my first trimester I was not felt comfortable because this my
        fisrt time to
        not live with my parents.I went home every weekend and I returned on monday morning.It was so hard for me
        because I had to go by foot .
        and I had to learn how can I manage my time and every day think about what kind of laoka(The laoka is one of
        two essential elements of Malagasy cuisine , with rice . This word refers to savorsy dishes that accompany
        the rice at every meal, like fish , meat zebu , the poultry , the cat meat has and many others.)should I
        buy.I felt really struggling during that time.</p>
      <p>After the first trimestry, I really enjoyed to stay in Imerimandroso
        .I got new friend who helped me for my study so I was really happy and I had learnt many things so it was good
        to live alone. </p>
