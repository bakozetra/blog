  <h2>My first trimester in high school</h2>
      <p>I learnt in high school Imerimandroso which is a town and commune (Malagasy: kaominina) in Madagascar .It belongs to the district of Ambatondrazaka, which is a part of Alaotra Mangoro Region. Imerimandroso is 7 kilometers from my village. I loved the high school because I get good at knowledge ..</p>
      <p>In 2013 I started to study in this school.In my first trimester,  I  couldn't feel comfortable with my new house . it is  my first time to separate with my parents.I went home every weekend and I returned on Monday morning.It was so hard for me because I had to go by foot . and I had to learn how can I manage my time and every day think about what kind of laoka(The laoka is one of two essential elements of Malagasy cuisine , with rice , others) should I buy?I was struggling  at that time..</p>
      <p>After the first trimester, I really enjoyed  staying in Imerimandroso .I got new friend who helped me for my study so I was really happy and I had learnt many things so it was good to live alone. </p>
