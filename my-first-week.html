    I am going to talk about my studies during last week..There were many elements which was the most interesting.
    It was really good to study about inline element because I can make my blog to more interesting.But even though the
    first time I study I was struggling because of that every time I asked my friends to explain to me how to use inline
    element.

    What should I take from the lesson last week?Many but I want to talk about my exercise. There was an exercise which
    is from my teacher it is about an inline element .I started at 8 a.m to work on it until 12 a.m but I couldn't solve
    it .My problem was I didn't think well and I just follow my friend's rhythm so I didn't know what should I do
    first.Then I started to read it carefully all the structures ,after I understood .Many lesson can take from that but
    this is the most important ,read ,think,and don't think about other,just do by yourself.

    It is good to learn new things and it helps to have mistakes so you can correct yourself as I did before.If I didn't
    make mistakes I will not read my exercise really careful so it is good to learn from mistakes.
